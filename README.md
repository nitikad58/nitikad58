### Hi, Glad to see you here!

I am a Fresher, with almost 14 months of internship experience as a Frontend Developer. I have an Integrated M.tech degree in Computer Science Engineering. I am a fast learner with excellent communication and technical skills, skilled in C++, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular & React.js. 

When I'm not working, I love to read books, it gives me new perspectives, and I learn something new about myself and the world around me. I also love to meet new people and converse, dance is another happy activity I engage in.

If you'd like to connect, feel free to DM or drop me a mail (nitikad58@gmail.com)
